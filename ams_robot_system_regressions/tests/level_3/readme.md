# **Level 3 - Intra-Application Write Tests**

The Level 3 test suite includes tests which Create, Modify, and Delete data from applications. The purpose of the tests in this Level should not be to test data propagation between applications, but rather only within a single application.

Any tests which require a specific configuration which is not configured as required in the environment the test is being ran against should be Skipped
