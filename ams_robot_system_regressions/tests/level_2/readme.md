# **Level 2 - Read Only Tests**

The Level 2 test suite includes only tests which do not call any endpoint that creates, modifies, or deletes data in any application. These are Read Only tests, intended to ensure that all endpoints which only retrieve data are called and return an expected response code and structure.
